<div>
    <p>Controls whether the "Use Groovy Sandbox" is shown in the system to users without Overall/Administer permission.</p>
    <p>This can be used to get a better UX in highly secured environments where all pipelines and other logics are
        required to run in the sandbox (ie. running arbitrary code is never approved)</p>
    <p>Note that this does not prevent users to configure and run pipelines or other logic with sandbox disabled if
        they create or update these configurations by other means (like CLI or HTTP API).
        This option is only hiding the checkbox from the HTML UI</p>
